# MARTIn (Median Algorithm Reduced Test Interface)

MARTIn is a chip proposed to test median algorithms and radiation tolerance. This chips aims to validade this design for future implementation in SALSA chip, a front-end readout ASIC begin developed by the CEA IRFU, France and USP, Brazil.

SALSA chip is a follow-up to the already know and well utilized SAMPA.

The contents of this chip is a innovative median finding algorithm applied in a simple filter (this filter algorithm should be presented at LASCAS 2025 (16th IEEE CASS Latin American Symposium on Circuits and Systems) ), LFSR and a shift register for radiation tolerance testing.
