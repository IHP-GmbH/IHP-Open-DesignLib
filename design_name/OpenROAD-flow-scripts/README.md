# Instructions to add new design

The directory structure follows the structure of the OpenROAD-flow-scripts tool. 

1. Copy your source code (Verilog files) into `designs/src/<design-name>/` directory.
2. Copy your configuration and constraint files into `designs/ihp-13g2/<design-name>/` directory.
3. Copy the results of the flow into `results/ihp-13g2/<design-name/base/` directory.
